#🔁 What Is a while Loop?
#A while loop in Python is used to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is True.

#Think of it like saying:
#🗣️ "Keep doing this until the condition is no longer true."
count = 1 
while count<9999 :
 print(count)
 count += 1
 
 #It stops after count becomes 9999 addding 1 until count becomes greater than 9998
