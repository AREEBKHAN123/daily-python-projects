🧮 Basic Calculator in Python
Welcome to my first Python project — a simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. Built for fun and learning! 🚀

✨ Features
📥 Takes user input for two numbers

➕➖✖️➗ Choose from addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division

🖥️ How It Works
The program asks the user to enter two numbers.

Then it shows a menu of operations:

 + for addition

 - for subtraction

 * for multiplication

 / for division

The user selects an operator.

The result is displayed on the screen.
📚 What I Learned
Taking and converting user input

Using conditional statements

Basic error handling

🚧 Future Ideas
Add support for exponentiation and modulo

GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt

Continuous calculation mode
